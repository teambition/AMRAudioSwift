# AMRAudioSwift
AMRAudioSwift is a useful tool to encode or decode audio between AMR and WAVE. It's written in Swift, and it supports [Bitcode](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH35-SW3).

In addition, AMRAudioSwift contains an audio recorder/player, which can record voice and play AMR data.

At the bottom level,  ```libopencore-amr``` is applied for audio decoding.

## How To Get Started
### Carthage
Specify "AMRAudioSwift" in your ```Cartfile```:
```ogdl 
github "teambition/AMRAudioSwift"
```

### Cocoapods
Specify "AMRAudioSwift" in your ```Podfile``` with the git url:

Note: The use of the git url can be removed when this library is published to Cocoapods.
```
pod 'AMRAudioSwift', :git => 'https://github.com/teambition/AMRAudioSwift.git'
```

### Usage
####  Configuration
```swift
let audioRecorder = AMRAudioRecorder()
audioRecorder.volume = ...
audioRecorder.isProximityMonitoringEnabled = ...
audioRecorder.isScreenBrightWhenPlaying = ...

// assign delegate
audioRecorder.delegate = self
```

#### Recording and Playing
```swift
audioRecorder.startRecord()
audioRecorder.cancelRecord()
audioRecorder.stopRecord()
audioRecorder.play(waveData)
audioRecorder.playAmr(amrData)
audioRecorder.stopPlay()
```

####  Implement delegate
```swift
func audioRecorderDidStartRecording(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDidCancelRecording(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDidStopRecording(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder, withURL url: URL?) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderEncodeErrorDidOccur(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder, error: Error?) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDidFinishRecording(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder, successfully flag: Bool) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDidStartPlaying(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDidStopPlaying(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDecodeErrorDidOccur(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder, error: Error?) {
    // do something
}

func audioRecorderDidFinishPlaying(_ audioRecorder: AMRAudioRecorder, successfully flag: Bool) {
    // do something
}
```

## Minimum Requirement
iOS 10.0
